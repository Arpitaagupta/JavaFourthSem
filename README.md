## Introduction

In this repository, you will find the Java programs and projects I worked on during my fourth semester at college. These projects cover various topics and concepts taught during the semester, including object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and more.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects or learning purposes. Please note that this repository is intended for educational purposes and may not represent production-ready code.

## Prerequisites

Before running or using the code in this repository, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) [version]
- [Other dependencies, libraries, or tools]

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/JavaFourthSem.git
```

2. Set up your development environment:

Install Java Development Kit (JDK) [version]. You can download the JDK from Oracle's website and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

Set up your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor for Java development. Some popular options include:

Eclipse: Download and install Eclipse from the official website. Once installed, import the cloned project into Eclipse.

IntelliJ IDEA: Download and install IntelliJ IDEA from the JetBrains website. After installation, open the cloned project in IntelliJ IDEA.

Visual Studio Code: Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website. Install the Java Extension Pack to enable Java development in Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

To run the Java programs or projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) [version] installed on your system. You can download the JDK from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk[version]-downloads.html).

2. Open a command-line interface or terminal.

3. Navigate to the directory where the Java source code file (`.java`) you want to run is located. For example, if you want to run the `ExampleProgram.java` file in the `src` directory, use the following command:

   ```shell
   cd path/to/JavaFourthSem/src
4. Compile the Java source file using the javac command followed by the filename. For example, to compile ExampleProgram.java, run the following command:
```shell
javac ExampleProgram.java
```
This will generate a compiled bytecode file (.class file) for the Java program.

5. Run the compiled Java program using the java command followed by the class name (without the file extension). For example, to run the ExampleProgram class, use the following command:
```shell
java ExampleProgram
```
The program output should now be displayed in the command-line interface or terminal.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for any other Java programs or projects you want to run from this repository.
